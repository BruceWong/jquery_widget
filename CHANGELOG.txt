0.1.2
-- fixed legend; icon was mapping to full path rather than simple filename
-- BUG: I.E. 7/8, where timeline was un-draggable, or timeline title failed to show up fixed
-- added "left" and "top" to data attribute of timeline title so that adjusting it later
   in "registerTitles" is not so DOM intensive as it has to use .position() in loop
-- FEATURE: maps can now be added into data with "map": object. Documentation forthcoming
-- tied "size_importance" property into timeline, so you can turn importance scaling off
   from timeline JSON: "size_importance":"false"
